# Restful-API-Golang
This is my first project created in Golang under the learning process. This project is a restful API project which provides crud operations. In this project, we performed the operations like creating a product updating a product product find the product by ID deleting a product by ID.

1)first create one folder:
mkdir goapi

2) Open the folder in VS Code.
3)download go packages from Google:-
go mod init example.com/goapi
4)download gorilla mux:-
go get -u github.com/gorrila/mux 
5)download gorm from google:-
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
6)download driver MySQL, because we use MySQL for db,
go get -u gorm.io/driver/mysql
7) then just use  the below command :-
   go build &./goapi.exe
